# make-issue-spec

There isn't a lot more to this than what the top level description says. The idea is 
for this issue spec to contain a clear specification of what is needed. Make sure to 
ask the user any questions for parts that you're not sure of or are under specified. 
Stage this in Git if you have permissions.
