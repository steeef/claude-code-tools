A collection of practical tools, hooks, and utilities for enhancing Claude Code
and other CLI coding agents.

<a id="quick-start"></a>
## 🚀 Quick Start

**Prerequisites:** Node.js 16+ (required for action menus)

**Step 1:** Install the Python package (includes Node.js UI components):
```bash
uv tool install claude-code-tools
```

**Step 2:** Install the Rust-based search engine (powers both human TUI and agent search).
Choose **one** of these methods:

- **Homebrew** (macOS/Linux): `brew install pchalasani/tap/aichat-search`
- **Cargo**: `cargo install aichat-search` (compiles from source, ~5 min)
- **Pre-built binary**: Download from [Releases](https://github.com/pchalasani/claude-code-tools/releases) (look for `rust-v*` releases)

That's it! No `npm install` needed — the Python package includes pre-installed Node.js dependencies.

Without `aichat-search`, search won't work, but other `aichat` commands (resume, trim, rollover, etc.) still function.

### What You Get

Four commands are installed:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [`aichat`](#aichat-session-management) | Continue work with session lineage and truncation, avoiding compaction; fast (Rust/Tantivy) full-text session search TUI for humans, CLI for agents  |
| [`tmux-cli`](#tmux-cli-terminal-automation) | Terminal automation for AI agents ("Playwright for terminals") |
| [`vault`](#vault) | Encrypted .env backup and sync |
| [`env-safe`](#env-safe) | Safe .env inspection without exposing values |

### Claude Code Plugins

This repo also provides plugins for the
[Claude Code marketplace](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/discover-plugins):

| Plugin | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `aichat` | hooks (`>resume`), commands, skills, agents for continuing session work and fast full-text search of sessions|
| `tmux-cli` | Terminal automation skill for interacting with other tmux panes |
| `workflow` | Work logging, code walk-through, issue specs, UI testing |
| `safety-hooks` | Prevent destructive git/docker/rm commands |

**Install the plugins:**

First, add the marketplace (from terminal or within a Claude Code session):

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add pchalasani/claude-code-tools   # CLI
/plugin marketplace add pchalasani/claude-code-tools         # in-session
```

This creates the `cctools-plugins` plugin group. Then install plugins from it:

```bash
# CLI
claude plugin install "aichat@cctools-plugins"
claude plugin install "tmux-cli@cctools-plugins"
claude plugin install "workflow@cctools-plugins"
claude plugin install "safety-hooks@cctools-plugins"

# Or in-session
/plugin install aichat@cctools-plugins
/plugin install tmux-cli@cctools-plugins
/plugin install workflow@cctools-plugins
/plugin install safety-hooks@cctools-plugins
```

You can also use `/plugin` without arguments to launch a TUI for browsing and installing.

#### Workflow Plugin Details

The `workflow` plugin provides:

| Skill/Agent | What it does |
|-------------|--------------|
| `/code-walk-thru` | Walk through files in your editor to explain code or show changes |
| `/log-work` | Log work progress to `WORKLOG/YYYYMMDD.md` |
| `/make-issue-spec` | Create task specs at `issues/YYYYMMDD-topic.md` |
| `ui-tester` agent | Browser-based UI testing via Chrome DevTools MCP |

## ⚠️ Breaking Change (v1.0)

All session tools are now under `aichat`. Use `aichat search` instead of
`find-claude-session`/`find-codex-session`, and similarly for other commands.

# 💬 aichat — Session Continuation and Search

## A bit of history

This probably belongs in a blog post or reddit post, but I think it helps understand
why this was built and what it does. And for those wondering, this section is one
of the few parts of the entire repo that is 100% hand-crafted since I just cannot
trust today's LLMs to write just the way I want. You can skip this history and [jump to the overview](#overview) if you want. So, here's how this all started. Session compaction is 
**lossy:** there are very often situations where compaction loses important details, e.g., I am at 90% context usage, and I wish I can go on a bit longer to finish the current work-phase. So I thought, 
> I wish I could just **truncate** some irrelevant long messages (e.g. tool calls/results for file writes/reads, long assistant responses, etc) and clear out some space to continue my work.

This lead to the [`aichat trim`](#three-resume-strategies) utility. It provides two variants:

- a "blind" [`trim`](#three-resume-strategies) mode that truncates all messages longer 
than a threshold (default 500 chars), and optionally all-but-recent assistant messages 
-- all user-configurable. This can free up 40-60% context, depending on what's been going on in the session.

- a [`smart-trim`](#three-resume-strategies) mode that uses a headless CLI-agent 
(Claude-Code or Codex-CLI depending on which agent the user has) to determine which 
messages can be safely truncated in order to continue the current work. The precise 
truncation criteria can be customized (e.g. the user may want to continue some 
prior work rather than the current task).

Both of these modes *clone* the current session before truncation, and inject two
types of [*lineage*](#lineage-nothing-is-lost):
- *Session-lineage* is injected into the first user message: a chronological listing
of sessions from which the current session was derived.
- Each truncated message also carries a pointer to the specific message index in the parent session so full details can always be looked up if needed.

Session trimming can be a quick way to clear out context in order to continue the current task for a bit longer, but after a couple of trims, does not yield as much benefit. But the lineage-tracking lead to a different idea to avoid compaction:

> Create a fresh session, inject parent-session lineage into the first user message, along with instructions to extract (using sub-agents if available) context of the latest
task, or skip context extraction and leave it to the user to extract context once the session starts. 

This is the idea behind the [`aichat rollover`](#three-resume-strategies) functionality. I wanted to make it
seamless to pick any of the 3 task continuation modes, when inside a Claude Code session, so I set up a `UserPromptSubmit` hook that lets the user type `>resume` (or `>continue` or `>handoff`) when close to full context usage. This
copies the current session id into the clipboard and tells the user to run
`aichat resume <pasted-session-id>` to launch a TUI that offers options to choose
one of the above [session resumption modes](#three-resume-strategies).
See the [demo video](#resume-demo-video) below.


The above session resumption methods are useful to contine your work from the
*current* session, but often you want to continue work that was done in an
*older* Claude-Code/Codex-CLI session. This is why I added this:

> Super-fast Rust/Tantivy-based [full-text search](#aichat-search--find-and-select-sessions) of all sessions across Claude-Code and
Codex-CLI, with a pleasant self-explanatory TUI for humans, and a CLI mode for Agents
to find past work.

Users can launch the TUI using [`aichat search ...`](#aichat-search--find-and-select-sessions) and (sub-) 
[agents can run](#agent-access-to-history-the-session-searcher-sub-agent)
`aichat search ... --json` and get results in JSONL format
for quick analysis and filtering using `jq` which of course CLI agents are 
great at using. There is a corresponding *skill* called `session-search` and a *sub-agent* called `session-searcher`, both
available via the `aichat` [plugin](#claude-code-plugins).
For example in Claude Code, 
users can recover context of some older work by simply saying something like:

> Use your session-searcher sub-agent to recover the context of how we worked on
connecting the Rust search TUI with the node-based Resume Action menus.


## Overview


`aichat` is your unified CLI command-group for managing Claude Code and Codex sessions.
Two main capabilities are available:

1. **Resume with lineage** — Continue sessions when context fills up, preserving
   links to parent sessions, avoiding lossy compaction.

2. **Search** — *Full-text search* across all sessions with a fast Rust/Tantivy-based 
TUI for humans, and CLI (with `--json` flag for jsonl output) for Codex or Claude (sub) 
Agent to search for past work. (Note that Claude Code's built-in search is not full-text
; it only searches the ad-hoc session titles created by CC, or renamed sessions). 

Examples:

```bash
aichat resume <session_id>     # Resume specific session with trim/rollover options
aichat resume                  # Resume latest session with trim/rollover options
aichat search "topic"          # Find sessions by keyword: for humans
aichat search "langroid mcp" --json # fast full-text search with jsonl output for agents
```

For detailed CLI options, run:
```bash
aichat --help              # See all subcommands
aichat <subcommand> --help # Help for specific subcommand
```

---

## Resume Options — Continuing work in a trimmed or fresh session, with lineage.


You have three ways to access the resume functionality:

**1. In-session trigger** — This is likely to be used the most frequently: while already in a Claude Code session, when you're close to filling up context, type:

```bash
>resume # or >continue, >handoff; MUST include the ">" at the start
```

This triggers a `UserPromptSubmit` hook that blocks handling by Claude-Code 
(hence no further tokens consumed), copies the current session ID to your 
clipboard, and shows instructions to quit Claude Code and run `aichat resume <paste>`. 
This is a quick escape hatch when context is filling up — no need to manually find the 
session ID.

*Requires the `aichat` plugin. See [Claude Code Plugins](#claude-code-plugins)
for installation.*

**2. [Search TUI](#aichat-search--find-and-select-sessions)** — Run `aichat search`, select a session, then choose a resume
action from the menu.

**3. Direct CLI** — Use these commands directly:

```bash
aichat resume abc123         # Resume specific session
aichat resume                # Auto-find latest for this project
```

### Three Resume Strategies

When you access the resume menu using any of the above 3 mechanisms, you will
be presented with 3 resume strategies, as described below.
All strategies create a new session with **lineage** — links back to
parent sessions that the agent (or preferable a sub-agent if available)
can reference at any time.

**1. Trim + Resume**

Truncates large tool call results and assistant messages to free up space.
Quick and deterministic — you control what gets cut. The default is to trim
*all* tool results longer than 500 characters, and *none* of the
assistant messages. This can
often free up 30-50% of context when applied the first time to a normal session
(depending on what's in the session). A quick way to extend a session a bit
longer without lossy compaction.

The TUI lets you specify:

- Which tool types to truncate (e.g., bash, read, edit, or all)
- Length threshold in characters (default: 500)
- How many assistant messages to truncate 
  (N => first N, or -N => all except last N; defaults to 0). 
  For example to truncate all except the last 10 assistant messages, use `-10`.

Same options available via CLI: `aichat trim --help`

**2. Smart Trim + Resume**

Uses headless (non-interactive) Claude/Codex agent to analyze the session and
strategically identify what can user/assistant messages or tool results can 
be safely truncated without affecting the *last* task being worked on. Slower than 
deterministic trim, but smarter and more selective.

The TUI lets you specify:

- Message types to never trim (default: user messages)
- How many recent messages to always preserve (default: 10)
- Minimum content threshold for extraction (default: 200 chars)
- Custom instructions for what to prioritize when truncating

Same options available via CLI: `aichat smart-trim --help`

**3. Rollover**

The trim strategies work well once or twice but eventually stop freeing much
context. *Rollover* is a better alternative after a couple of trim iterations,
or directly from a normal session. This strategy hands off work to a fresh
session, injecting *session-lineage* pointers and an optional agent-generated summary of the current task. The session lineage pointers are a chronologically ordered
list of session jsonl file paths, of the parent session, parent's parent, and so on,
all the way back to the original session.
The new session typically starts with 15-20% context usage, 
and the agent or sub-agent can retrieve details from ancestor sessions on demand,
either if prompted by the user, or on its own when looking up prior work.


The TUI lets you specify:

- Which agent (Claude or Codex) to resume with — start in Claude Code, hand off
  to Codex for heavy refactoring, then back to Claude Code for finishing touches
- Rollover type:
  - **Quick rollover** — Just preserves lineage pointers, no context extraction.
    Fast, but you'll need to ask the agent to look up prior work as needed.
    If you install the `aichat` [plugin](#claude-code-plugins), you'll have access
    to the `/recover-context` command — the agent reads parent sessions and pulls
    relevant context into the current conversation.
  - **Rollover with context** — Uses a headless Claude/Codex agent to extract summary   
     of current work into the new session.
- Custom context recovery instructions (e.g., "focus on the authentication changes")
  — only available when using "Rollover with context"

Same options available via CLI: `aichat rollover --help` (use `--quick` for
quick mode, `-p "prompt"` for custom extraction instructions)

### Lineage: Nothing Is Lost

Unlike compaction (which permanently loses information), all strategies preserve
the complete parent session:

- **Lineage chain** — file paths of all ancestor sessions
- **On-demand retrieval** — agent can read any past session when needed

```
Original Session (abc123)
 └─► Trimmed/Rollover 1 (def456)
      └─► Trimmed/Rollover 2 (ghi789)
           └─► ... chain continues
```

See [here](docs/rollover-details.md) for details on how rollover works.

## aichat search — Find and Select Sessions

Uses Tantivy (Rust full-text search) to provide fast search across all your Claude and Codex sessions.

Here's what it looks like:

![aichat search demo](demos/aichat-search-asciinema.gif)

```bash
aichat search                      # Interactive TUI for current project
aichat search "langroid MCP"       # Pre-fill search query
aichat search -g                   # Global search (all projects)
aichat search --json -g "error"    # JSONL output for CLI-agents
```

**How it works:**

- **Auto-indexing:** Sessions are automatically indexed on startup—no manual
  export or build steps needed.
- **Self-explanatory TUI for humans:** Filter by session type, agent, date range, and more. All options are visible in the UI.
- **CLI options:** All search options are available as command-line arguments. Run
  `aichat search --help` for details.
- **JSON mode for Agents:** Use `--json` for JSONL output that CLI-agents can process with
  `jq` or other tools. See [Session-Searcher sub-agent](#agent-access-to-history-the-session-searcher-sub-agent), which is available
when you install the `aichat` plugin mentioned above.

**Session type filters:**

By default, search includes original, trimmed, and rollover sessions (but not
sub-agents). Use flags to customize:

```bash
aichat search                       # Default: original + trimmed + rollover
aichat search --sub-agent           # Add sub-agents to defaults
aichat search --no-original         # Exclude originals (show trimmed + rollover)
aichat search --no-trimmed          # Exclude trimmed (show original + rollover)
aichat search --sub-agent --no-rollover  # Add sub-agents, exclude rollovers
```

**Subtractive flags** (exclude from defaults): `--no-original`, `--no-trimmed`,
`--no-rollover`

**Additive flag** (add to defaults): `--sub-agent`

---

## Conceptual Flow: Search → Select → Actions

The typical workflow:

1. **Search** — Use `aichat search` to find sessions by keywords, date, or filters
2. **Select** — Choose a session from the results
3. **Actions** — Perform operations on the selected session

After selecting a session, you see the **actions menu**. This is equivalent to
running `aichat <session-id>` or `aichat menu <session-id>` directly.

**Session ID formats** (accepted by most commands):

- Full path: `~/.claude/projects/.../abc123.jsonl`
- Full ID: `abc123-def456-789-...`
- Partial ID: `abc123` (if unique)

---

## Session Actions

After selecting a session, the action menu offers:

- **Show path / Copy / Export** — File operations
- **Query** — Ask questions about the session using a headless Claude-Code/Codex agent
- **Resume options** — Various strategies for continuing work (see below)

---


### Agent Access to History; the Session-Searcher sub-agent

Your agent can search across all historical sessions using the JSON output
mode:

```bash
aichat search --json -g "error handling"  # Returns JSONL for programmatic use
aichat search --json --by-time            # Sort by last-modified time
```

This enables agents to find and retrieve context from any past session in the
lineage, either on their own initiative or when you prompt them to look up
historical context.

Installing the `aichat` plugin mentioned above creates a `Session-Searcher` sub-agent 
(for Claude-Code) that has instructions to either directly search a known session jsonl 
file if clear from context, or use `aichat search --json` to search past sessions. 
E.g. in Claude Code you can say:

> From past sessions, recover details of our work on task-termination specification in Langroid agents/taks configuration.

This will trigger the `Session-Searcher` sub-agent to search past sessions for the specified query.

# 🎮 tmux-cli — Terminal Automation

> **Note**: While the description below focuses on Claude Code, tmux-cli works with any CLI coding agent.

![tmux-cli demo](demos/tmux-cli-demo-short.gif)

**Think Playwright for terminals** - Terminal automation for AI agents.

tmux-cli enables Claude Code to programmatically control terminal applications:
test interactive scripts, debug with pdb, launch and interact with other CLI agents.

**Important**: You don't need to learn tmux-cli commands. Claude Code handles
everything automatically—just describe what you want.

**Works anywhere**: Automatically handles both local tmux panes and remote sessions.

<a id="tmux-cli-deep-dive"></a>
## 🎮 tmux-cli Deep Dive

### What Claude Code Can Do With tmux-cli

1. **Test Interactive Scripts** - CC can run and interact with scripts that 
   require user input, answering prompts automatically based on your instructions.

2. **UI Development & Testing** - CC can launch web servers and coordinate with 
   browser automation tools to test your applications.

3. **Interactive Debugging** - CC can use debuggers (pdb, node inspect, gdb) to 
   step through code, examine variables, and help you understand program flow.

4. **Claude-to-Claude Communication** - CC can launch another Claude Code instance 
   to get specialized help or code reviews.

Claude Code knows how to use tmux-cli through its built-in help. You just describe 
what you want, and CC handles the technical details.

For complete command reference, see [docs/tmux-cli-instructions.md](docs/tmux-cli-instructions.md).

### Setting up tmux-cli for Claude Code

To enable CC to use tmux-cli, add this snippet to your global
`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` file:

```markdown
# tmux-cli Command to interact with CLI applications

`tmux-cli` is a bash command that enables Claude Code to control CLI applications 
running in separate tmux panes - launch programs, send input, capture output, 
and manage interactive sessions. Run `tmux-cli --help` for detailed usage 
instructions.

Example uses:
- Interact with a script that waits for user input
- Launch another Claude Code instance to have it perform some analysis or review or 
  debugging etc
- Run a Python script with the Pdb debugger to step thru its execution, for 
  code-understanding and debugging
- Launch web apps and test them with browser automation MCP tools like Playwright or 
Chrome Dev Tools.
```

More frequently, I use this method: I launch another CLI-agent (say Codex-CLI) 
in another tmux pane, and say something like this to the first agent:

> There's another coding agent "Codex" running in tmux Pane 3. Feel free to use Codex 
to help you with your task or review your work. You can communicate with Codex using
the tmux-cli command; you can do tmux-cli --help to see how to use it.

## Tmux-cli skill

To make it easier to have Claude-Code use this command, there's a **tmux-cli plugin** in this repo; once you install it, you can simply say "use your tmux-cli skill to get help from Codex running in tmux pane 3".

For detailed instructions, see [docs/tmux-cli-instructions.md](docs/tmux-cli-instructions.md).

All of this assumes you're familiar and comfortable with tmux, and (like me) run
all CLI coding sessions inside tmux sessions.


<a id="lmsh-experimental"></a>
# 🚀 lmsh (Experimental)

Natural language shell - type what you want in plain English, get an editable command.

```bash
# Direct usage - translate, edit, execute, then enter interactive mode
$ lmsh "show me all python files modified today"
find . -name "*.py" -mtime 0  # <-- Edit before running

# Or interactive mode
$ lmsh
lmsh> show recent docker containers
docker ps -n 5  # <-- Edit before running
```

**Features:**
- Rust-based for instant startup (<1ms binary load time)
- Translates natural language to shell commands using Claude Code CLI
- Commands are editable before execution - full control
- Preserves your shell environment

**Note:** Requires Claude Code CLI (`claude` command) to be installed. The translation adds ~2-3s due to Claude Code CLI startup.

**Installation:**
```bash
# Install from crates.io (easiest, requires Rust)
cargo install lmsh

# Or build from source
cd lmsh && cargo build --release
cp target/release/lmsh ~/.cargo/bin/
# Or: make lmsh-install
```

See [docs/lmsh.md](docs/lmsh.md) for details.

<a id="status-line"></a>
## 📊 Status Line

A custom status line script for Claude Code is available at
[`scripts/statusline.sh`](scripts/statusline.sh). It displays model name,
project directory, git branch, git status indicators, and a context window
progress bar that changes color as you approach the limit.

![green](demos/statusline-green.png)
![yellow](demos/statusline-yellow.png)
![orange](demos/statusline-orange.png)
![red](demos/statusline-red.png)

To use it, copy the script and configure Claude Code:

```bash
cp scripts/statusline.sh ~/.claude/
chmod +x ~/.claude/statusline.sh
```

Add to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "statusLine": {
    "type": "command",
    "command": "~/.claude/statusline.sh"
  }
}
```

Requires `jq` and a [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) for powerline symbols.

# 🔐 Utilities

<a id="vault"></a>
## 🔐 vault

Centralized encrypted backup for .env files across all your projects using SOPS.

```bash
vault sync      # Smart sync (auto-detect direction)
vault encrypt   # Backup .env to ~/Git/dotenvs/
vault decrypt   # Restore .env from centralized vault
vault list      # Show all project backups
vault status    # Check sync status for current project
```

### Key Features

- Stores all encrypted .env files in `~/Git/dotenvs/`
- Automatic sync direction detection
- GPG encryption via SOPS
- Timestamped backups for safety

For detailed documentation, see [docs/vault-documentation.md](docs/vault-documentation.md).

<a id="env-safe"></a>
## 🔍 env-safe

Safely inspect .env files without exposing sensitive values. Designed for Claude Code and other automated tools that need to work with environment files without accidentally leaking secrets.

```bash
env-safe list                    # List all environment variable keys
env-safe list --status           # Show keys with defined/empty status  
env-safe check API_KEY           # Check if a specific key exists
env-safe count                   # Count total, defined, and empty variables
env-safe validate                # Validate .env file syntax
env-safe --help                  # See all options
```

### Key Features

- **No Value Exposure** - Never displays actual environment values
- **Safe Inspection** - Check which keys exist without security risks
- **Syntax Validation** - Verify .env file format is correct
- **Status Checking** - See which variables are defined vs empty
- **Claude Code Integration** - Works with protection hooks to provide safe alternative

### Why env-safe?

Claude Code is completely blocked from directly accessing .env files - no reading, writing, or editing allowed. This prevents both accidental exposure of API keys and unintended modifications. The `env-safe` command provides the only approved way for Claude Code to inspect environment configuration safely, while any modifications must be done manually outside of Claude Code.

  pattern
- **Git Commit Protection** - Requires user approval before any git commit
  (uses Claude Code's permission prompt UI)
- **Git Add Protection** - Smart staging control:
  - Hard blocks: `git add .`, `git add ../`, `git add *`, `git add -A/--all`
  - New files: Allowed without permission
  - Modified files: Requires user approval (permission prompt)
  - Directories: Uses dry-run to detect files, asks permission if modified files
- **Environment Security** - Blocks all .env file operations (read/write/edit),
  suggests `env-safe` command for safe inspection
- **Context Management** - Blocks reading files >500 lines to prevent context
  bloat
- **Command Enhancement** - Enforces ripgrep (`rg`) over grep for better
  performance

### Installation

Install the `safety-hooks` plugin as described in
[Claude Code Plugins](#claude-code-plugins).

### Available Hooks

- `bash_hook.py` - Main hook that orchestrates all bash command checks
- `git_commit_block_hook.py` - User permission prompt for git commits

## 🤖 Using Claude Code with Open-weight Anthropic API-compatible LLM Providers

You can use Claude Code with alternative LLMs served via Anthropic-compatible
APIs, e.g. Kimi-k2, GLM4.5 (from zai), Deepseek-v3.1, [MiniMax-M2.1](https://platform.minimax.io/docs/guides/text-ai-coding-tools).
Add these functions to your shell config (.bashrc/.zshrc):

```bash
kimi() {
    (
        export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=https://api.moonshot.ai/anthropic
        export ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN=$KIMI_API_KEY
        claude "$@"
    )
}

zai() {
    (
        export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=https://api.z.ai/api/anthropic
        export ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN=$Z_API_KEY
        claude "$@"
    )
}

dseek() {
    (
        export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=https://api.deepseek.com/anthropic
        export ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN=${DEEPSEEK_API_KEY}
        export ANTHROPIC_MODEL=deepseek-chat
        export ANTHROPIC_SMALL_FAST_MODEL=deepseek-chat
        claude "$@"
    )
}

ccmm() {
    (
        export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=https://api.minimax.io/anthropic
        export ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN=$MINIMAX_API_KEY
        export API_TIMEOUT_MS=3000000
        export CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC=1
        export ANTHROPIC_MODEL=MiniMax-M2.1
        export ANTHROPIC_SMALL_FAST_MODEL=MiniMax-M2.1
        export ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL=MiniMax-M2.1
        export ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL=MiniMax-M2.1
        export ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL=MiniMax-M2.1
        claude "$@"
    )
}
```

After adding these functions:
- Set your API keys: `export KIMI_API_KEY=your-kimi-key`,
  `export Z_API_KEY=your-z-key`, `export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your-deepseek-key`,
  `export MINIMAX_API_KEY=your-minimax-key`
- Run `kimi` to use Claude Code with the Kimi K2 LLM
- Run `zai` to use Claude Code with the GLM-4.5 model
- Run `dseek` to use Claude Code with the DeepSeek model
- Run `ccmm` to use Claude Code with the MiniMax M2.1 model

The functions use subshells to ensure the environment variables don't affect
your main shell session, so you could be running multiple instances of Claude Code,
each using a different LLM.

### Using Claude Code and Codex with Local LLMs

You can run **Claude Code** and **OpenAI Codex CLI** with local models using
[llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp)'s server for fully offline usage.

- **Claude Code** uses the Anthropic-compatible `/v1/messages` endpoint with models
  like GPT-OSS-20B, Qwen3-Coder-30B, Qwen3-Next-80B, and Nemotron-3-Nano
- **Codex CLI** uses the OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint with GPT-OSS

For complete setup instructions including llama-server commands, config files, and
command-line options for switching models, see
**[docs/local-llm-setup.md](docs/local-llm-setup.md)**.

## 🛠️ Development

### Architecture

The `aichat` command has three layers:

- **Python** (`claude_code_tools/`) - CLI entry points, backend logic, session parsing
- **Rust** (`rust-search-ui/`) - Search TUI with Tantivy full-text search
- **Node.js** (`node_ui/`) - Action menus (resume, export, trim, etc.)

Flow: Python CLI (`aichat search`) invokes Rust binary → Rust TUI for search →
user selects session → hands off to Node.js menus → menus call Python backend.

### Prerequisites

- **UV** - `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`
- **Rust/Cargo** - `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`
- **Node.js 16+** - Required for action menus

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pchalasani/claude-code-tools
cd claude-code-tools
uv venv --python 3.11
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
uv sync
cd node_ui && npm install && cd ..
make install                  # Python (editable mode)
make aichat-search-install    # Rust binary
```

### Testing Changes

- **Python**: No action needed (editable mode - changes apply immediately)
- **Node.js**: No action needed (runs directly from `node_ui/`)
- **Rust**: Run `make aichat-search-install` to rebuild and install

### Publishing (Python Package)

For releasing to PyPI:

```bash
make all-patch   # Bump patch, push, GitHub release, build
make all-minor   # Bump minor, push, GitHub release, build
make all-major   # Bump major, push, GitHub release, build
uv publish       # Publish to PyPI (after any of the above)
```

These commands automatically:

1. Run `make prep-node` to ensure `node_ui/node_modules/` is up-to-date
2. Bump version → push to GitHub → create GitHub release
3. Build package (includes `node_modules/` so users don't need `npm install`)

Then run `uv publish` to upload to PyPI.

**Note:** Users need Node.js 16+ installed to run `aichat` action menus, but
they do NOT need npm — the package includes pre-installed dependencies.

### Publishing (Rust Binaries)

```bash
make aichat-search-publish  # Bump version and publish to crates.io
make lmsh-publish           # Bump version and publish to crates.io
```
