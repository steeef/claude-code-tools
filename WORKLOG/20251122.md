## 18:18 - tmux-cli Pane Targeting Bug Fix

**Session ID:** 4a18eb14-846b-4f2d-80d6-266a5757eeaf

**Files Created:**
- `issues/20251122-tmux-cli-pane-targeting.md` - Issue spec for pane
  targeting bug

**Files Modified:**
- `claude_code_tools/tmux_cli_controller.py` - Fixed `list_panes()` method
  (line 217)

**Description:**

Fixed bug where tmux-cli was targeting panes in the currently active/visible
window instead of the window where the command was executed from. Modified
`list_panes()` to use `get_current_window_id()` (which reads `TMUX_PANE`
environment variable) when no explicit target is provided. Now pane indices
correctly resolve within the executing window regardless of which window is
currently visible.
